# About Me

Hello! I'm Hemanth krishna pursing Ph.D. candidate at IIT Mandi, India, specializing in Low Power VLSI Design, Approximate Computing, and Ternary Arithmetic Circuits. My research is dedicated to creating optimized, energy-efficient circuit architectures that advance computational efficiency for applications in image processing and neural networks.

### Research Focus
- **Approximate Computing**: I design approximate adders and multipliers that prioritize energy savings while maintaining performance, particularly using 5:2 and 4:2 compressors.
- **Ternary Arithmetic Circuits**: Exploring ternary (base-3) logic systems for arithmetic operations to achieve more efficient computation, with applications in emerging ternary neural network models.
- **CNTFET Technology**: Leveraging CNTFETs for low-power VLSI designs that enhance energy efficiency, especially in multiplier circuits and custom pooling operations for neural networks.

### Skills
- **Hardware Description Languages**: Proficient in VHDL and Verilog for hardware simulation and synthesis.
- **Circuit Design and Simulation**: Experienced with Hspice for circuit design, focusing on low-power, high-performance arithmetic circuits.
- **Data Analysis & Visualization**: Skilled in Python and Matplotlib for data visualization, especially for evaluating circuit performance metrics like SSIM, PSNR, NMED, and MRED in image processing applications.

### Projects
- **Optimized Energy-Efficient Approximate Multiplier Design**: Developing a novel 5:2 compressor-based multiplier with applications in neural networks and image processing.
- **Custom Pooling Circuits**: Creating approximate average and max pooling circuits tailored for ternary neural networks, with comparator-based designs in CNTFET technology.
- **Ternary 4:2 Compressors**: Designing compressors with ternary inputs for efficient addition, supporting applications in video processing and machine learning.

Feel free to explore my repositories and reach out if you're interested in collaborative research or have questions about my work. Let's push the boundaries of efficient computation together!
